                <p>Hello! My name is Justin Lee and I am currently a sophomore at Dublin High School. I believe that there are a lot of different paths and careers to seek and dive into during your high school years, as that is what I am currently doing. As of right now I am interested in the field of chemistry, english literature, and psychology. Looking into my junior year of high school I plan on taking classes such as AP Chemistry, AP Language Arts, and AP Psychology to continue seeking into my passion, but as of now I am taking different varieties of classes to seek for other possible career majors I may find interest in going into college. All throughout school I have learned to be cooperative with others from activities, and there have been many times when something was really hard to understand for me, but I managed to fully understand something by constantly studying and trying to understand the concepts. I have played many sports outside of school, so I know that being cooperative and persistent is very important in many other situations as well. From past experiences like these, I learned that it takes a lot of effort and practice to really comprehend things, and it is not as simple as I thought. I am still working and trying to achieve all of my goals as I find other possible career paths that would be best for me with the current skills that I possess.</p>
                <p>However as for now, my goal is to graduate high school with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, english literature, or psychology. During my time in college, I would like to be at volunteers or other extracurricular activities based on the major I am studying in college, as well as applying for possible part time jobs to help me get more familiar and experienced in the field I look to pursue. I believe that I would be able to learn even more about the field itself along with learning new skills as I interact and work with new and different people everyday and the environment. Working with a different area with new and unique individuals everyday would help me learn how to adapt to the environment and how to be as efficient and sufficient as I can. Working with different backgrounds would give me experience for the career field where I would be working with different problems and situations everyday. I am even currently learning how to be as productive as I can and work with the current problems and environment right now with the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Everyday I am learning and discovering new ways I can complete and understand my work for school everyday, as well as developing skills and other extracurricular activities.</p>
                <p>My goal no matter where I am or what situation I am in is to be able to work with what I have and how I can be as productive and efficient as I can be. I am eager to constantly learn how to develop and grow as a person and what I can contribute and learn from any possibilities. There is more information about me throughout this website, and if there are any other questions about me, feel free to contact me!</p>
