                <p>Hello! My name is Justin Lee and I am currently a sophomore at Dublin High School. I believe that there are a lot of different paths to take after your high school years, and I am still searching for a career path, although I am leaning a little towards interest in the field of chemistry and engineering. I am currently taking different varieties of classes and determining which majors I would find most interest in when I go to college. All throughout school, I have learned to be cooperative with others from activities, and there has been many times when something was really hard to understand for me, but I managed to fully understand something by constantly studying and trying to understand the concepts. I have played many sports outside of school, so I know that being cooperative and persistent is very important in many other situations as well. From past experiences like these, I learned that it takes a lot of effort and practice to really comprehend things, and itâ€™s not as simple as you think. I am working and trying to achieve all of my goals as I find which career path would be best for me with the current skills that I possess.
