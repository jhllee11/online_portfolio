         <h2> Description:</h2>
        <h6>In this project, I worked with a partner to create and develop a video game app. The objective of this game is to control a character and try to reach the lightning bolts without encountering the obstacles(dinosaurs) in both levels. This was the first project of the year in the Computer Science Principles course and it introduced the world of coding and programming through building blocks. As we programmed this game, we learned about the complexity of the functions in the codes used for the features of the game. In addition, the game we made was original, so the process and thought to build a new game with different features and abilities took a long time, but overall this project was a good learning experience on how to work and cooperate with other peers and how to use other sources given effectively to add more development within the codes.

    <h2>Escape Room Python Challenge</h2>

    <h5> <strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles</h5>
    <h5> <strong>Project:</strong> Python Escape Room</h5>

         <h2> Description:</h2>
        <h6>In this project, I worked with a partner to make and develop a simulation of an escape room situation. The first thing that my partner and I did was brainstorming on a specific theme for this escape room, and we decided to go with a modern day cultural theme that is also very popular within many people's interest, and decided to make our theme about the Golden State Warriors. To develop further in our project, my partner and I made a flowchart on the storyline of the simulation and the possible different routes that the simulation would have, basing them off of what decision the person in the simulation makes. We decided that the person in the simulation is locked inside of a room in the Golden State Warriors Chase Arena and the objective of this simulation is to find clues by solving basketball trivia questions to find the way out of the room they are locked in. They would be given a certain amount of lives and if they answer the question correctly without using up all of their lives they would progress into the success of leaving the room, but if they get the question wrong and lose all of their lives they would lose the game and would have to restart at the beginning. As this was our first project using Python, we learned how to apply the code functions of the new language into this project. We gave each other roles on how to contribute to this project as I helped my partner with the if-else functions on how the person in the simulation answers the question and the transitions, and small features such as the life count along with the documentation. During this project, there were a few small errors that came along like the live count and the transitions based on the answers chosen, but my partner and I were able to communicate well and fix the problems as we tried out different codes so that the function would be beneficial throughout the simulation. Overall we had a positive outcome of the project and learned how to apply the new code that we learned because of our sufficient communication.
